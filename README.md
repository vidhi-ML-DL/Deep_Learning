# PERCEPTRON:
The single perceptron works well for linear data. It is also called as Binary Classifier as it creates a line in 2D and hyperplane for higher dimension which seperates the data into two regions.
3 codes are written for single perceptron which shows the importance of weight initialization and how it depends the data. It was shown that different lines can be formed due to randomly selecting rows for getting correct weights.
